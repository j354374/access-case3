   <p>Dear TT:<br>
   <i>Dressing twins alike is considered "cute", however I don't want my children
   to be considered objects and I dislike the confusion that comes from dressing
   them alike. On the other hand, it's extra work to shop for two different
   styles of clothes all of the time. What do you suggest?<br>
   - D.P. Otomawa, IA</i></p>

   <p>The desire to dress identical twins alike is almost irresistible, and you're 
   right, it does save time shopping as well. It's hard to find clothing in the 
   style, size and price that you want, and why double your trouble? Consider 
   purchasing clothing that is similar in style, but not identical. Most 
   clothing patterns will come in different varieties (blue stripes versus red 
   stripes, etc.). Purchase these combinations. Your twins will be dressed 
   similarly, but not exactly alike. You should also remember to go to resales 
   offered by your local twins or multiple births organizations. You will 
   probably be able to make substantial savings compared to buying the clothes
   new.</p>

  <p>Dear TT:<br>
  <i>My twins are entering first grade. Should I have them separated into different
  classes?<br>
  - M.A. Cleveland, OH</i></p>

  <p>Different schools will have different policies regarding keeping twins
  together in class. You should first check with your school to see if they
  have established such a policy. If not, the answer to your question depends
  on your children. In some cases, a child will flourish without having his
  or her twin nearby. In other cases, this absence of support and familiarity
  that a twin brings, can be very hard. You should talk to your children and
  find out how they feel about the issue. The bottom line is that a happy and
  comfortable environment is the best enviroment for your twins to learn in.</p>

  <p>Dear TT:<br>
  <i>I'm opposed to using disposable diapers, but cleaning the diapers of my
  triplets is a full day job. Help!<br>
  - S.J. Crawford, PA</i></p>

  <p>Consider using a diaper service. Your local twins or multiple births club can
  direct you to a service in your area. The service will collect the soiled
  diapers, clean them and return them to you a week later. Diaper services
  are often cheaper than disposable diapers.</p>

  <p>Dear TT:<br>
  <i>When and how should I introduce solids to my twins?<br>
  - M.K Omaha, NE</i></p>

  <p>Mothers are advised to give their infants milk until they are about three
  months old, with most infants moving onto solids between three and four
  months. Twins however, since they are usually smaller than singleton babies,
  may need to continue with milk longer than this. Remember though, that every
  child and family is different, so you should start solids at a date that
  you're comfortable with.</p>

  <p>Start with vegetables or fruits that have been cook and either liquidized
  or strained. Cereal is also a popular food for your babies. You can
  moisten the cereal to a thin cream with the addition of a little formula.</p>

  <p>Dear TT:<br>
  <i>I'm looking to purchase a stroller. Do you have any suggestions about the
  type of stroller I should buy?<br>
  - W.W. Savannah, GA</i></p>

  <p>You're in luck. This month's issue of TwinLife, contains an informative
  article on different types of twin strollers. Check it out.</p>
