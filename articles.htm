   <p>Communication occurs long before speech. Babies communicate with their
   parents through crying, laughter, smilying and pointing. The attentive
   parent quickly becomes attuned to this "non-speech" communication. At some
   point, usually in the second year of life, babies will begin to add a single
   words to these acts of expression. A baby will point to a cup and say, "drink."
   The names "Mama" and "Dada" are among the first out of the baby's mouth.</p>

   <p>As the child gets older, he or she will add new words to these expressions and
   will begin to use words in combination: "get drink me." The parents provide
   visually and audio feedback to the child, encouraging the development of
   the speech process.

   <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3" color="red">Switching Roles</font><br>
   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="1">By Karen Kerkman, PhD</font></p>
   <font size="2"><p>Role playing is a common twin behavior. One twin will become the leader and the
   other will become the follower. One may become the talker and the other, the
   listener. In some cases, these roles become permanent and the behavior
   associated with those roles become part of the child's personality. In many
   other cases however, these roles will be switched on a periodic basis, leaving
   their confused parents' heads spinning! This behavior can be found in other
   sibling pairs, but it is most pronounced with twins.</p>

   <p>Twins also seem to know much more about each other and what the other one is
   thinking. Twins will typically excel at guessing games. Twins seem to be
   sensitive to both verbal and non-verbal clues. It is possibly this intimate
   understanding of one another, that allows them to switch their roles so
   quickly. There almost seems to be an unspoken understanding between the twins,
   "okay, now I'll let you lead for awhile."</p>

   <p>For the casual observer, this can
   be very disconcerting. Despite the stories that sometimes appear in magazines
   and tabloids, there is no evidence that this unspoken communication amounts
   to ESP or any other unexplained phenomenom.</p>

   <p>When twins swap roles, it makes it difficult for others to maintain a
   clear idea of their separate natures. Lacking a clear division of personalities,
   it is more difficult for others to tell the twins apart. Hence, we are more
   likely to group the twins as a unit, rather than as separate individuals.</p>

   <p>As twins grow older, they may increasingly dislike this grouping and strive
   to establish completely unique identies. Parents may want to help this
   process along is a healthy and beneficial way. You should encourage the 
   aspects of each twin's personality that seems to be unique to him or her.
   The parent can be a great helper in giving the twin a sense of individuality
   without losing the special bond shared with his or her twin.</p></font>

   Through a process called "echoing", parents will naturally
   repeat what their child says, proving an important confirmation that what
   the child has said has been heard and understood.</p>

   <p>With twins, the situation may be slightly different. Often parents cannot
   provide the one-to-one feedback that single children routinely enjoy. It
   may be that the one most often listing to the twin and providing feedback is
   the other twin.</p>

   <p>While the other twin is usually a very attentive and eager audience, he or
   she can not provide the type of feedback needed for language development. Twins
   can not correct each other's mistakes in the use of words or grammar. Moreover,
   by communicating with each other, twins are necessarily decreasing the amount
   of communication they are performing with adults and older children. In some
   cases, twins become such good audiences for each other, they lose interest
   in communicating with their parents.</p>

   <p>In rare cases, this one-to-one communication can progress to the point at
   which a shared language is created. The twins will come up with their own
   words, and in some cases, their own grammatical structures. The languages
   are unintelligible to anyone else but the twins. These cases are very rare,
   even though they are well publicized. The twin's secret language will usually
   disappear by age 4 or 5, as the children become more adept at using their
   parent's language.</p>

   <p>What can you do to help you twins in acquiring language? The most important
   thing you can do is pay individual attention to each child. Easier said than
   done! Provide feedback to the child as he or she gropes with language.
   If you are feeding your twins, talk to one child as the other is eating. 
   Then, when the first child is eating, switch to the second. When changing
   diapers, use the one-on-one time (one hopes) to further provide the
   audio clues needed for picking up speech.</p>

   <p>As with everything that is twin-related, language acquistion requires some
   extra work on the part of the parents; but again with twin-related activites,
   the extra work is paid off in extra fun.</p>
